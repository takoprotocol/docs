# Introduction

Every individual has a profile on social apps, which is an essential digital asset.&#x20;

By embracing the "profile-as-an-asset" concept, we can activate our profile key through contracts.

The key can be traded without matching buyers and sellers, with pricing determined by the contract and transactions executed directly by the contract.

If a user significantly influences their followers, many people will be interested in purchasing their profile key. As the circulation of the key increases, the key price will also rise, allowing both the issuer and holders of the key to profit from it.

You can integrate your application's functionalities related to "profile-as-an-asset" using APIs or contracts. And add more features to your app to attract users, such as establishing a chat community and airdropping rewards to traders.
