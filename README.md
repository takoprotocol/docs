# What is Tako?

Tako Protocol is an open social monetization protocol, dedicated to providing open and permissionless infrastructure for the decentralized social networks and the creator economy. Utilizing Tako, creators can monetize or tokenize their content and amplify their influence. Curators can monetize their influence and customize their on-chain advertisements. The protocol enables everyone to find their own value discovery model, participate in the discovery and investment of assets within the social network, and even build their own creator economy.

Tako Protocol offers developers flexible, combinable APIs, a suite of developer-friendly SDKs, and a variety of application development cases. Additionally, it supports popular decentralized social networks and connects a diverse range of social dApps. This integration enables developers to participate in the construction of decentralized social networks and the creator economy with low barriers to entry and high efficiency.

In conclusion, Tako upholds the principles of open-source, permissionless, community-driven collaboration and co-creation, positioning itself as an essential player in the transformative journey of the next generation of social networks.

## Core Values

Tako's principles, embedded in its open-source code, are designed to empower users and ensure that recommendations are permissionlessly created, improved, and governed by users:

*   **User-Centric**

    Embracing the concept of 'User as a Curator', Tako allows all types of users, including content creators, curators, and consumers, to participate in the recommendation process. Users can curate or promote any content they value and have full control over their social experience, aligning it with their interests.
*   **Value-Matching**

    By adding ”value“ to the content, each recommendation in this ecosystem is curated after careful evaluation. This value-matching recommendation model boosts content liquidity and its value flow in Web3 Social, fostering a more vibrant and organic sharing and recommendation environment.
*   **Seamless Multi-ecosystems Experience**

    Tako is meticulously designed for compatibility with virtually any open social protocol and multiple blockchains. It frees users from the constraints of single platforms or social networks, and provides developers with efficient integration of Tako APIs. Tako thus provides an expansive environment for content creators and audiences to connect without barriers.
